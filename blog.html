		<h2>what is increasingly not enough/to seek a middle way</h2>
		<p class="date">[May 2019]</p>
		<h3>When I was younger, just my community was enough. My needs were fulfilled by it; its logic around faith and history, which were given to me by my family and elders, made sense. The more intimately I understood it as an adult, however, the more I felt it was necessary to gift it, over and over again, the generosity of context, and a world around it. But even with more and more context, the position and agency of my faith community within the wider group of Muslims in America became blurrier with age, even while my awareness of the blurrinesses in other faith communities increased. Observing Ramadan, for me, is a claiming of space for me and my community in the confusion of colors and shapes that is the wider Muslim community, a community that has sometimes rejected us, and sometimes been rejected by us. For me, it is a way to say, “We are here, too; we are of you, and you us.”</h3>
		<h3>On a practical level, I am objectively bad at Ramadan. I have trouble slowing down, I do not retain my patience in the face of want, I sometimes break my fast early, and sehri is sometimes on time, sometimes whenever I wake up. I do not swear less — I work in a newsroom. More devastatingly, <a href="https://traversingtradition.com/2018/06/04/ramadan-month-of-anti-imperialism/" target="_blank">I work in a capitalistic system</a>, so my days, even during Ramadan, are dictated by labor and profit, and not by my intrinsic value as a soul from the viewpoint of the divine. It seems that every Ramadan I observe, I am reminded of how far I am, how far we are, from what a life oriented by the centering of the spirit feels like.</h3>
		<h3>For much of this Ramadan, as part of a youth program I help with every year, I spent my days thinking about civil rights and the history of the Muslim community in the U.S. — from enslaved African Muslims to South Asian immigrant Muslims to Central Asian refugee Muslims to white convert Muslims. We talked about what oppression can look like among immigrant communities, and how hierarchies are perpetuated particularly firmly in South Asian Muslim communities. Most challenging was articulating the complexities of this reality to young people — a way of gently shattering the perfection they wanted to see and showing instead, just as gently, that the existence of blurrinesses in their understandings of their community is a form of clarity, because it is accurate.</h3>
		<h3>Much like how adults respond to blurriness around something into which they’ve invested time, some people embraced these realities and many decidedly did not — a reminder that an instinct toward justice or truth is not magically or automatically higher among younger generations. I felt frustrated. In the early mornings during suhoor, I read parts of the Qur’an.</h3>
		<h3>While the Ramadan of my youth was mostly about breakfast foods at Eid celebrations, the Ramadan of my adulthood has increasingly been about a balancing of two particular ayaat that reflect the frustrations that I have not been able to settle:</h3>
		<h3>“Do not follow blindly what you do not know to be true: ears, eyes, and heart, you will be questioned about all these. Do not strut arrogantly about the earth: you cannot break it open, nor match the mountains in height.” (17:36-7)</h3>
		<h3>The pairing of these ayaat encourage me to “seek a middle way” (17:110) between the necessity of continuous critical thinking and reasoning around the established systems of a community, while retaining an attitude of humility and patience as a form of love toward those around me, if nothing else, as a reflection of the awe a Muslim, a person, can experience toward the divine. The anti-complacency and active compassion this requires — and the grace of this reminder in the Qur’an — is enough for this month.</h3>

		<h2>Assess your big mistakes every ten years.</h2>
		<p class="date">[2017]</p>
		<h3>2007 is the year I moved to New York and began university. My dad helped me move, and I still remember the panic that overtook me in my core when, on our last evening together, he dropped me off to my residence hall and walked away. At that moment, I was certain I was unprepared to be alone, neither to sustain myself nor succeed at anything. I had no idea how to quiet the terrified restlessness in my heart that exists within all 18-year-olds, whether they are brave enough to admit it or not (I was not).</h3>
		<h3>2017 has been a year during which I made strides, long and aggressive and intentional, in admitting things — out loud, to other people — in a furious chase for catharsis. This has its own terrors associated with it, but one of the perks of approaching 30 is that dishonesty doesn’t quite weigh on you as much as it feels like one more annoying thing to remember to do for someone else’s comfort, one more way to grip desperately onto someone’s conditional affinity toward you.</h3>
		<h3>When I think about the time between 2007 and 2017, the thing I did most frequently is make mistakes. Some very small (I once repeatedly addressed a female hiring manager as a “Mr.” via email until she sent me an understandably angry clarifying note) and many quite large (I have yet to be able to get myself to enjoy kale and this seems to have had a much larger impact on my life than I anticipated it would in 2007). But wait, there’s more:</h3>
		<h3>-- Once, instead of “try to be forgiving toward yourself,” I said, very somberly, “try to be forgiving toward your elf.”</h3>
		<h3>-- I stopped writing sometime after grad school. Not much news, not much fiction, not much prose, not even a consistent journal. When I did write, it was in disjointed phrases that looked like they were trying — and failing — to be poetry. I wrote them down and never looked at them again because, to me, they looked suspiciously like proof that I had lost something valuable. Because writing is how I, like many, clarify and process my thoughts, this made for some incredibly foggy years.</h3>
		<h3>-- I felt it important to post so many angry, true and juvenile posts about 1. Republicans and 2. the parts of the Harry Potter movies that weren’t completely accurate. Both of these made me equally angry, for some reason.</h3>
		<h3>-- For a long time, I stopped playing basketball, which is something that brings me pure joy. I stopped for enough time that when I started again, it took actual concentration to not get injured, and even with concentration, I had some lasting injuries.</h3>
		<h3>-- Like all of us who make big mistakes in our twenties, the insecurities I didn’t know I harbored became cynicism and dismissiveness toward those who were close enough to me that kindness seemed less important than straightforwardness. In hindsight, with lots of distance and lots of painful reflection, I know that this was, at its core, an act of profound, consequential ingratitude, and it is perhaps the only aspect of this decade — the only mistake — that I have neither been able to process, nor reconcile, nor forgive.</h3>
		<h3>-- Several times in the 2010s, I wore a blazer over a t-shirt that said “Imagination” on it, but with the blazer on, you could only see the “agina” part, so everyone thought I was wearing a t-shirt that said “vagina.” AND YET I DID NOT STOP WEARING THAT COMBINATION.</h3>
		<h3>-- I spent too much time with socks on.</h3>
		<h3>-- Between 2007 and 2014, I did not even kind of drink enough water.</h3>
		<h3>-- I enthusiastically performed the flawed idea that if someone is part of you, you must carry their every pain/dishonesty/debt for them, out of love and protectiveness, and they must carry yours — that this is how love is measured, that love can be measured.</h3>
		<h3>-- I was there for only five years, but I may have lived in New York City for much too long.</h3>
		<h3>-- Somehow, I wasn’t wearing the right glasses for my face-shape before 2016.</h3>
		<h3>-- Somehow, I didn’t read any Audre Lorde before 2016.</h3>
		<h3>-- Somehow, I learned and then promptly forgot a lot of Arabic, Farsi and Urdu before 2016.</h3>
		<h3>-- It took about four years for me to feel truly comfortable asking for help with any code I wrote, which is several years of unproductive mistakes.</h3>
		<h3>Here’s one thing I did right over the past ten years: I was choosy and persistent about courting the relationships I wanted to keep. Achieving any amount of honesty at 29 takes a huge time investment between 18 and 28, and when, inevitably, somewhere in there, your life shifts dramatically, it’s the people into whom you’ve invested time and effort who will perceive what those life shifts mean for your interiority. This kind of homemade, worn-in honesty, even once per decade, is maybe all the catharsis you need.</h3>

		<h3>Islam For Reporters tracks data on Islamophobic incidents in the U.S. and provides tools for reporters covering Islam-related issues or Muslim American communities.

		<h2>Ali Asani on the denial of identity</h2>
		<p class="date">[Winter 2013]</p>
		<h3>Ali Asani came to the U.S. from Kenya, started as an undergraduate student at Harvard, and then just never left. Today, he’s a professor of Indo-Muslim and Islamic Religion and Cultures and Director of the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Islamic Studies Program at Harvard. I’ve had the pleasure of working with Asani and I’ve always been struck by the nuance in his arguments and, more importantly, his immense humility. We spoke a bit about his own navigation of identity and the global aspect of Islamophobia:</h3>
		<h3><i>People often say, okay the Jews went through this, and the Catholics went through this, and the Irish went through this and Italians went through this. And it’s true that you know it’s part of the whole process of becoming American, you have to go through this. I do see it as different. Unlike I think some of those other groups, you don’t have the manifestation of this at a global level…It’s not just the U.S. It’s a global phenomenon. You see it in Europe, definitely. You see the links between Islamophobic groups in Europe with those in the U.S., but you also see it in places like India. You see it in Bosnia. You see it in Burma. You can see it in many, many different places. You see it in Russia. You see it in China…And that’s what I think makes it a little bit different from saying, okay, this is a normal part of the American hazing experience. That’s what I think makes it dangerous. Because it’s global.</i></h3>
		<h3>He told me what struck him about election-time Islamophobia and the revision of history in people’s minds:</h3>
		<h3><i>The thing that really stood out to me as an Islamophobic thing was made by Rev. Rod Parsley who was spiritual advisor to John McCain and who wrote in his book “Silent No More,” among other claims he makes, that 9/11 was a call to arms because America was founded in part to see the false religion of Islam destroyed, and that’s why America was created. And 9/11 now means that we are in a full-fledged war with Islam. That, for me, was an outrage because it’s just a revisionist form of reading history and documents and texts. When I saw that, I said, wow. And you can see how it was tied with the whole election of Obama. And that behind it was this whole idea that Obama was a secret Muslim and that electing him is going to be the ultimate triumph because now Muslims will be in power, they’ve taken over the White House and then they’re going to take over the country. So this was a strategy pandering to people’s fear for Islam — “Do not vote for Obama because if you vote for Obama, it’s a vote for Islam, it’s a vote for the enemy.” The implications of all of that are just astounding.</i></h3>
		<h3>On the many ways he was denied his own identity in the U.S.:</h3>
		<h3><i>When I came to Harvard as an undergraduate, one of the things I was astonished about was how ignorant people were about Kenya — they didn’t know where it was — and their perceptions about who was African. So someone like me would not qualify as African because, “Oh, you must be from India.” Even though my family’s been two generations in Africa. So I would say there was this broad illiteracy. My first encounter was this illiteracy about Africa that impacted me directly because people were not able to label me correctly or they thought I was a misfit or they wanted to impose their own labels on me, so you have to be — you can’t be African. And in Africa, people who are of Indian origin are called Asian. So if I said I was Asian, “No, you can’t be Asian because Asian means you’re Chinese.” So I was denied my African identity, I was denied my Asian identity, and then at a certain point I would find out of course that they were also very ignorant about Islam as well.</i></h3>

		<h2>Jocelyn Cesari: It’s worse in Europe</h2>
		<p class="date">[Winter 2013]</p>
		<h3>I met up with Jocelyn Cesari at Harvard’s Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program office. She is a Senior Research Fellow at the Berkley Center for Religion, Peace and World Affairs at Georgetown University and directs the Islam in the West Program at Harvard University. She explained to me why Europe’s Muslims have it much harder than America’s:</h3>
		<h3><i>I would say that, even when it concerns the Islamic or religious signs only, the discrimination is higher for Muslims in Europe because it is not automatically an institutional discrimination, while I think in the U.S., most of the discrimination comes from policy-making or institutional settings, but not automatically from the society, although you will find groups that will say, “Yes, it has increased,” but if you look at where Islamophobia comes, it comes in police or law enforcement, it comes in airport and air traffic regulation; it’s not dominant in civil society, despite what Muslims are saying. But in Europe, it’s both an institutional discrimination — and a strong one, sometimes — but it’s also day-to-day discrimination by people who are not Muslim and who would attack women with hijab, or refusing to provide halal food, or refuse to acknowledge when kids are fasting. You have more of these things going on, that come more from a daily life perspective. I know that activist groups here tend to say that Muslims are in a bad situation; I’m not saying that there are no reality to that, but if I compare to the life of Muslims in Europe — immigration, they are at stake; ethnicity and culture, they are at stake. Economically, too, when people talk about underclass or ghettos, they think Islam. It’s not the case in the U.S. Any kind of laws about security of the country, they are at stake. And then you have the daily discrimination. And very little recourse.</i></h3>
		<h3>She also explained why the biggest problem in the U.S. is not the media, but the politicians:</h3>
		<h3><i>When you hear politicians — and I have heard them — all this started against the building of mosques in the U.S. and some politicians saying that Islam is not a religion and cannot be protected by the first amendment. These are very — for me, this is much more worrisome. Because then, what do you expect the media to do? They have to report on that, too. They are not making things up. They are also giving visibility to things and positions that people have that are far from being favorable or easy on Muslims. The whole shari’a campaign. It was not a media campaign. It was really orchestrated by anti-Islamic groups in different cities with the role of so-called experts coming and being concentrated in different localities. And Muslims have not even asked for shari’a in this country, which is mind-boggling to me. It’s whole construct — yes, the media report on it — but I would say they are not building it. I would say that some are trying to be more fair in the way they are report about Islam.</i></h3>

		<h2>Omid Safi on waging beauty after 9/11</h2>
		<p class="date">[Winter 2013]</p>
		<h3>I’ve told myself that, at some point in my life, I’m going to go on a trip to Turkey with Omid Safi and Illuminated Tours. But, for now, just a conversation with Safi will have to do. I met up with him on UNC, Chapel Hill’s beautiful campus in January to talk about the different kinds of Americans America has, the Iranian blogosphere and our perceptions about the worth of different lives. On using 9/11 as a measurement tool: </h3>
		<h3><i>I have to say, as somebody who adamantly and unapologetically adopts a global humanistic outlook, of course I’m frustrated as much as the next person when 9/11 is allowed to become the new birth of Christ. It’s what you measure everything before and after it…I think it’s important for us to pause and think about, how do we have a conversation in which we can say, with the same breath, with the same moral commitment, that we mourn and stand against the actions of 9/11 and the loss of human life, and at the same time, we have to think about, what does it mean if the loss of 3,000 human lives on American soil is allowed to re-write the global order in a way that the loss of 30 million people with HIV in sub-saharan Africa does not? Or the loss of millions of lives in Vietnam or in other conflicts does not?…And actually, in North America, we’re completely unwilling to enter that conversation — it does say a lot about our assumption about the superior worth of some lives over others.</i></h3>
		<h3>On the oft-sighted “kind-of-sort-of-basically-tolerated-as-long-you-keep-quiet-and-go-to-the-suburbs Americans” around the time of the Park 51 controversy:</h3>
		<h3><i>I’m interested in the conversation about Islamophobia, but I actually don’t think you solved the problem by persuading people that Islam is great. I mean, I’m a professor of Islamic Studies, I teach about Islam. Obviously, I’m committed to presenting accurate and scholarly views of Islam, but I don’t think you solve this by just replacing people’s stereotypes about Islam. The place where you have to fight this fight — it’s an American conversations. It’s about laws; they bought this land legally. You don’t like it? Tough. It’s a conversation about citizenship. These are American citizens. If they’re American citizens, they’re allowed to do what other American citizens can do. We don’t like all of our citizens, but nowhere is it written in the Constitution that us liking each other is a prerequisite to people getting to exercise their constitutional rights. And I think that’s really the conversation that I want to see us have, I want to see Muslims have and non-Muslims have. Let’s have this based on liberties and civil rights and constitutional rights and freedoms. What does it mean to be American? Are all of us equally American? Are some of us really American? And others are kind-of-sort-of-basically-tolerated-as-long-you-keep-quiet-and-go-to-the-suburbs Americans? And I think that’s really the conversation I’m much more interesting in having now.</i></h3>
		<h3>On Iranians, who are just a Google hit away:</h3>
		<h3><i>One small example: Iran’s not a particularly large country, or it’s not in terms of population — certainly nothing compared to India or Pakistan. It’s a country of 77 million people — less than a quarter of the population of the U.S. And there’s very few other countries in the world in which Persian as a language is a major presence. Persian is now the fourth most heavily blogged language in the world. Iranians, in spite of and perhaps because of the extraordinarily repressive mechanisms of censorship imposed on them by their government, are among the most tech-savvy and connected and wired populations on the planet. Many of them have websites which are mirroring in Persian and English…I think that the overwhelming majority of Americans cannot name an Iranian who’s not a cleric, whether it’s Khomeini or Ahmedinejad when he was in power as the president. Hopefully now, they can at least add the figure of President Rouhani. But there’s such a broad range of artists and musicians, civil society workers, women’s rights activists, spoken word artists who are just a Google hit away.</i></h3>
		<h3>On becoming “khalils”:</h3>
		<h3><i>There’s this beautiful Qur’anic metaphor — the Prophet Abraham was thrown into the fire and God rescues him from the fire, and makes the fire be cool towards him. And interestingly enough, the Qur’an says when God rescues Abraham, Abraham or Ibrahim in Arabic, becomes called the “khalil,” which is called “the intimate friend of God.” And I’ve oftentimes used that metaphor for the condition of Muslims in post-9/11 America. A number of things can happen to people when they’re thrown into the fire — you can either burn, or you can emerge as a “khalil,” you can emerge as an intimate friend of God, and I see both having taken place in the Muslim community. I see lots of burnt and burnt out Muslims, but I also see people that have gone through the crucible of purification and have emerged as these moral beings that not only are interested in defending their own community, but are really engaged in a redemption process that there are people who are waging beauty, unrelentingly, and are interested in uplifting and transforming and redeeming this wider world that we all actually share. And that community gives me an immense amount of hope… There’s an extraordinary number of women in that population, there are African Americans, brown Muslims, white converts, Latino Muslims, for whom these kind of sectarian labels of Sunni and Shi’i are much less relevant than, “Who are you?”, “How deep do you love?”, “Whom are you serving?” and “Where is the community that you’re devoting yourself in service to?” Those are the important places that I look to and draw inspiration from.</i></h3>

		<h2>Carl Ernst: There is no “Muslim world.”</h2>
		<p class="date">[Winter 2013]</p>
		<h3>I read Carl Ernst’s “Following Muhammad” in 2007, back when it was my dream to study Persian literature and become an academic. Understandably, I was fan-girling a bit when I finally got to meet him in person. Ernst is the Kenan Distinguished Professor of Islamic Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. As someone who has been directly involved with Islamophobia and the media, he had some very blunt advice for journalists:</h3>
		<h3><i>If you want to tell a good story, you can get a skeleton from a single person, but you need to have a little bit of context and know where they’re coming from. And one of the most important things to say is, there is no “Muslim world.” There is no separate planet that is inhabited exclusively by Muslims who somehow have never had any contact with America or Europe…What you need to know if you want to understand a Muslim is, what country do they come from? What political formation? What economic class? What ethnic group? What language? What religious teaching or grouping or community or tradition? What tendencies are there? Because there are lots of different things going on. The next thing to do after listening to somebody, if you want to have a context, you need to know the kinds of things you would need to know about anyone to place them in time and space, because they’re not on some remote asteroid out there that just zoomed in for a quick bit of terrorism.</i></h3>
		<h3>He spoke a bit about the need for more Muslims in journalism, education, the arts and culture, etc.:</h3>
		<h3><i>In recent years, in fact for quite some time, I’ve had this conversation when I’ve been invited to speak to Muslim groups. I ask, you know, what are the professions of the people who are there and then I ask how many people are involved in journalism, the arts and culture? And there’s hardly anyone. And so my question at that point is, for people who are worried about Islamophobia and about media representations of Muslims, if you’re not involved in it, you really don’t have very much of a right to complain. I think that, for people like yourself who are going into journalism, education, the arts and culture, that’s a very appropriate thing to do and it needs to have more attention by everyone.</i></h3>
		<h3>And he gave me a little bit of his own background:</h3>
		<h3><i>I had an experience as an exchange student in South America when I was 16 and I was kind of taken aback by how little prepared I was for that experience. And this drew my attention to the way in which many Americans are simply not in a good position to be familiar with other cultures. People come here from around the world, but then it’s no longer necessary for us to know anything about those other cultures. That’s the paradox. So I think international studies and global culture is a big challenge for American education. So I’ve really devoted my career to that. So I asked myself at one point — I thought religious studies would be a good way to deal with this because it deals with such a profound level, that goes all the way through culture, society, you name it. And then — what is the area of biggest ignorance? To say Islam is the area of biggest ignorance is still obviously the case.</i></h3>

		<h2>Eli Clifton: America is just one poorly-regulated fraternity.</h2>
		<p class="date">[Winter 2013]</p>
		<h3>The Center for American Progress came out with a report in 2011 that did some important Islamophobia-related math: the Islamophobia industry — an American industry built on the fear of almost one-sixth of the world’s population — is a $40 million industry. $40 million. Reporter Eli Clifton did some of the math for the report. I spoke to him in January. We talked about the funds, the players and the consequences. We talked about the oft-mentioned “clash of civilizations” viewpoint on Islam and the West:</h3>
		<h3><i>I understand where folks like Peter King come from, and it’s from a view of Islam and the West as two things at war. It’s a dangerous narrative because it’s al-Qaeda’s narrative; that is the narrative of the terrorists – that Islam and the West are inherently in conflict, that of course they’re at war. I mean, you’re quite literally letting the terrorists win if that’s the type of rhetoric and perspective on Muslims that you’re adopting.</i></h3>
		<h3>We talked about America’s hazing process:</h3>
		<h3><i>As a country, we’re probably getting better at identifying when we’re suggesting that a certain group doesn’t fit in the United States. Jews, Catholics, the Irish, the Italians, Japanese Americans have all faced similar types of charges. The story hasn’t changed that much. It’s a pretty consistent set of charges that are laid against “the other.” And I think we’re getting better at identifying it. That’s a narrative right there — to talk about how this is largely an immigrant community, how this fits into an American narrative. And it’s a good story, I think. America is just one poorly-regulated fraternity.</i></h3>
		<h3>We talked about what makes him angry about American counterterrorism efforts:</h3>
		<h3><i>My view is that counterterrorism is best accomplished by treating it as a criminal problem. You shouldn’t glorify terrorists and you glorify them when you buy into the narrative that they are involved in a war, a cultural or religious war. You should treat them as common criminals. You try to set off a bomb, we’re going to treat you as a criminal. We’re not going to give you the glory of being some sort of a war hero. I found that very troubling. That’s a very lousy way of going about counterterrorism training, to suggest that we’re involved in this centuries-old conflict. No. Your job is to stop terrorism in all forms. If the terrorists happen to be Muslim. The problem is that they’re terrorists; it’s not that they’re Muslim. You’re giving them their narrative, and you shouldn’t be.</i></h3>

		<h2>Let’s talk to the guy who was MSA president at NYU when 9/11 happened.</h2>
		<p class="date">[Winter 2013]</p>
		<h3>When I interviewed Haroon Moghul, he told me he’s tired of being a “professional Muslim” and he’s trying now to focus on other things that are a part of his identity. My first thought was that if this actually happens, we’ll have lost one of our funniest professional Muslims. I got a laugh while transcribing this interview because Haroon and I talked for a solid five minutes about how special it feels to go to the eye doctor (“It’s all about which one I think is better,” he explains. “They’re like, ‘This one or this one?’ and I’m like, ‘Show me other ones.'”) Why is he so funny?</h3>
		<h3><i>Humor always works. Humor terrifies people who don’t like you. If you are at all approachable, it destroys their narrative. So, I’ve been invited to discussions with very hostile audiences, where I will just play a comedian. It drives them off the wall. When you win over part of an audience, you’ve won. I think humanizing communities is really important.</i></h3>
		<h3>We spent a good amount of time talking about why the Iraq War was more relevant for Islamophobes than 9/11:</h3>
		<h3><i>I was in New York on 9/11, I had the great fortune of being MSA president at NYU, which is like a 15-minute walk from Ground Zero; we all saw it happen. What I saw in New York is, in that year after 9/11, that was my senior year, there was a lot of anger, obviously. There was hate and frustration, but there wasn’t a narrative provided to people to make sense of 9/11. And as a result, I think, people didn’t know what to do with this event. And when you don’t know what to do with an event, you don’t know how to respond thereafter. I think that the need to come up with a narrative to justify the Iraq War is what created the upsurge in Islamophobia…How we responded to 9/11 is really a critical issue. We could have made it a police action, we could have made it a ‘We’re just going to take out al-Qaeda’ thing, but instead we made it a ‘We’re going to invade Iraq and Afghanistan’ thing. And all these things are connected – so this secular Arab dictator has something to do with this religious zealot in Afghanistan? I don’t know, let’s make it up. I think that created the context for the momentum and basically it took off from there.</i></h3>
		<h3>We talked about the consequences of the surveillance of Muslim American communities:</h3>
		<h3><i>I think the main issue is that, 1. You’re not allowed to do this, you know? You have to show a cause for it. And 2. It has an effect on people. It affects the way they behave and it affects the meaningfulness of democracy. This applies to the NSA as well. And 3. It’s just a waste of money. And 4. The problem we have in the U.S. is that we never really look at context. Now that you have the drone wars and special operations command and the CIA running the kill list and things like that, we believe or we’ve been led to believe that we have a clean war. We don’t invade countries; we’re just firing missiles at bad guys. But nobody has ever explains how this ends. You’ve just kind of gotten through 9/11, the Iraq War, the Afghanistan War, and there’s just another wave of al-Qaeda being produced. It’s just going to happen again and again and again and again…So you’re just creating this monster and eventually it becomes autonomous. It seeks out threats to justify itself. And if there are no threats, it will invent threats.</i></h3>
		<h3>We spoke a bit about his theory that we should be funding Islamophobes:</h3>
		<h3><i>I see Islamophobia as a positive force. It forces people to be on their game. If you don’t have an opponent…I think Muslims are lucky because most Islamophobes are idiots. Like, they’re just not very intelligent people. They reproduce their ignorance whenever they’re presented with anything different. So my theory for Islamophobes is that we should be funding them. Just give them a microphone and let them talk. Eventually, they’ll say something about black people or gay people or women or Latinos and then, goodbye. We may not be the third rail, but something in there is the third rail.</i></h3>

		<h2>Intelligent discussions and “Princess Bride” references with Hussein Rashid</h2>
		<p class="date">[Winter 2013]</p>
		<h3>No one I know makes more sci-fi/fantasy references in conversations about <i>anything at all</i> (including Islamophobia) than Hussein. A New Yorker, professor, blogger and leader, Hussein is one of the reasons my own interest in Muslim American communities and Islamophobia developed. I talked to him in New York last week. We talked a bit about the weaknesses of journalists and editors:</h3>
		<h3><i>News media also looks for easy stories. So we look for words that we think the audience understands, that don’t really mean what we think they mean.  It’s this Princess Bride moment – “I do not think that word means what you think it means.” Jihad, shari’a, Allah, the Qur’an – these are words that have very specific meanings. Jihad, for example has a very modern definition, but then you try to read it back into 1400 years of history and it doesn’t make sense, and unless you start cutting and trimming stuff, it’s going to tell you a very different story than what you’re trying to tell. I understand there’s only so much you can write in 800 words, but I think careful selections in word choice, looking for experts in the field rather than the loudest voices, would go a long, long way...</i></h3>
		<h3><i>...I think if we look at the entertainment industry, it’s a really mixed bag there, but I would be remiss in not shouting out some really great explorations of what it means to Muslim. And I don’t mean shows like “All American Muslim.” You know, in the Simpson’s, Bart had a Muslim friend, which was a really great episode about this whole Islamophobia thing that the “average American” feels. Bones or NCIS, they have really great story lines around Muslims and are they perfect? No, but that’s kind of the point, right? Muslims are human beings and the all-evil representation is as bad as the all-perfect representation. You need complex, nuanced representations of Muslims because Muslims are people at the end of the day. You’re going to get the unsung heroes and you’re going to get the people you pass by on the street every day.</i></h3>
		<h3>He explained what he means by “intelligent discussions”:</h3>
		<h3><i>Part of what I do is try to create more intelligent discussion around religion generally and Islam specifically. A lot of this came out of, interestingly, not September 11, but the run-up to the second Iraq War in 2003. People were saying that al-Qaeda was in bed with the Iranians. But wait, do you actually understand that al-Qaeda thinks the Iranians are heretics and they deserve to be put to death because they’re Shi’i? So, how did we get to be friends with them? And that they’re partnering with Saddam Hussein, who’s a secularist with a religious nationalist movement – do you actually understand anything about how these pieces fit? Oil and water do not mix and realpolitik can only cover so much of that. It was at that point that I realized people just don’t know that much about religion. The term now is “religious illiteracy.” And I think anti-shari’a legislation is a good example of this. People say, “Oh, you must mean only Muslims because shari’a is a scary, foreign-sounding word,” but not actually realizing the things it’s affecting are other communities who live by religious laws, like Jews and Catholics.</i></h3>

		<h2>Hind Makki wants to clean our dirty laundry.</h2>
		<p class="date">[Winter 2013]</p>
		<h3>If you’re a Chicago-area Muslim, you’ve probably heard of Hind Makki or seen her blogs, Hindtrospectives and Side Entrance. I interviewed her a couple weeks ago.</h3>
		<h3>She talked a little about Side Entrance, a blog that documents “the beautiful, the adequate and the pathetic” of women’s prayer spaces in mosques:</h3>
		<h3><i>I was always interested in how different communities build their mosques. At least in my mosque, women and girls were encouraged to go, they would give lectures, they were part of the community. Lots of other communities don’t do that. I remember very clearly, when I was 15 years old, my sister, my dad and and I went to a mosque in Devon Street, which is a heavily immigrant, South Asian community in downtown Chicago, and we went to a mosque to attend the Friday prayer. We got there and my dad goes, “Okay, where are my girls gonna go?” And the uncle said, “Oh, there’s no place for women.” And my dad’s like, “Where are they going to go?” This was before cell phones. The uncle’s like, “They can stay in the car.” And we were like, “Wait, do we not need to pray?” It was such a weird experience...</i></h3>
		<h3><i>...I was in a mosque in downtown Chicago that had a really small space for women; it’s not where women pray for Friday prayers or Taraweeh prayers during Ramadan, but it is where you go if want to duck in there and pray on a random day, it is where you’re going to pray. It’s eight feet wide, twenty feet tall. I took a picture of this and posted it on my Facebook. What surprised me was that my Muslim male friends were like, “What the fatwa?” That started me thinking: “I wonder what my Muslim male friends would say if they saw where Muslim women pray.” I think that Muslim men and women need to work together; it says in the Qur’an that believing men and believing women are partners to each other. That little picture that I posted, my Muslim male friends were shocked...</i></h3>
		<h3><i>...I’ve gotten some flack for the name, Side Entrance. Some men have been like, “Why are you calling it that?” And I say, “Because I literally have to enter through a side entrance to get into a mosque!” I’ve actually gotten much more support than flack, but the flack I have gotten is about Islamophobia. Some boys have said to me, “Well, why are you giving fodder to Islamophobes?” My response to them is, “We need to clean our dirty laundry.” This is true – this is our dirty laundry. Islamophobes will say, “Look at how Muslim women are treated in their mosques.” We need to clean it.</i></h3>
		<h3>And she gave some suggestions to media organization on how to better include the narratives of Muslim Americans:</h3>
		<h3><i>If a reporter has a contact who is of a Muslim background, they can ask, what else can you talk about? They can pass that contact around to talk about other things. Most Muslims in this country fall into four professional categories: doctor, engineer, small business owner, cab driver. You want to talk about medical ethics issues? Okay, well, if the president of the mosque is a doctor, maybe you want to reach out to him or her. Set aside the Islamophobia question and ask, “What do you think about this medical issue? What do Muslims think about this ethical issue?” For small business owners, “What do you think about this local zoning issue?” It’s important to expand how Muslims can contribute to public conversations...</i></h3>
		<h3><i>...For me, one of the reasons I wanted to do Hindtrospectives, my blog, was because I write a lot about Muslims, interfaith, women, racism, I love that stuff. I live and breathe and read that stuff all the time. But I also really want to write about Sleepy Hollow, I want to write about the intersection of popular culture and religion or race. I’m happy to talk about that! Nobody’s ever talked to me about that. When I got my media appearances earlier this year, it was about Muslim women, women in scarves, Femen, things like that. I’m happy to talk about it, but it’s not the whole of who I am. I love figure skating! How come nobody’s ever asked me about figure skating?</i></h3>
		<h3>“What the fatwa?” is definitely my new favorite phrase.</h3>

		<h2>These are the worst things that could happen to me on a travel reporting trip.</h2>
		<p class="date">[Winter 2013]</p>
		<h3>I’m sitting in an airport food court area at 4:30 a.m. surrounded by depressed-looking single travellers and even-more-depressed-looking pairs of travellers when the feelings hit me: the creeping, deep-in-the-black-hole-that-is-your-gut sadness that repeats to your brain, over and over again, and echoes throughout your entire being, “You are alone. You will fail. You should give up.”</h3>
		<h3>I’ve just begun my first ever one-woman travel reporting trip for a project upon which my Master’s degree depends. I should be excited and nervous, like on the first day of school, but I’m not. I’m (and I’ve considered these terms carefully) sad and puke-y, like when you’re in grad school. I don’t really have enough energy to spend on being sad and puke-y, given the importance of this project and the lack of time I have to complete it, so I’ve decided to just face my fears. Below is a list of the worst things that could happen to me on a travel reporting trip.</h3>
		<h3>I could interview everyone and then realize my camera was off/the lens cap was on the whole time.</h3>
		<h3>My camera could break.</h3>
		<h3>I could miss a plane or bus and have to call a source and be like, “Uhhh, I missed my bus.” And they could be like, “Wow, you’re a massive failure and I hate you.”</h3>
		<h3>I could lose my belongings and then have to use a makeshift tripod for every interview.</h3>
		<h3>A variety of places I go to eat and rest could just not have coffee.</h3>
		<h3>I could just spend all my travel time thinking about how life is really just a long process of dying and how small we are and how really, nothing we do matters and the people we call our own will leave us in a variety of ways and the chances of each person finding people they are compatible with is slim to none and how, for most of us, in just 80-100 years, no one will remember who we were or what we did.</h3>
		<h3>I could get back to school and find out my audio sucks a whole lot and it isn’t usable at all.</h3>
		<h3>I could get a call from Berkeley while I’m out reporting and they could be like, “We just checked our records and realized we were actually trying to accept the other Nausheen into the j-school, not you. Lol sorry!”</h3>
		<h3>I could get a call from my mom and she could be like, “Oh hey, I don’t love you anymore. Hope you’re well, ttyl.”</h3>
		<h3>(I know the last two are highly unlikely, but admit it, you’ve thought them, too.)</h3>
		<h3>Reporting and life are both for the brave. I will try to be one of the brave.</h3>

		<h3><strong>A Treasury Of Kahlil Gibran</strong></h3>
		<h3>…With two hearts do/People live; a small one of deep/Softness, the other of steel. And/Kindness is too often a shield,/And generosity too often a sword.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Octavia’s Brood</strong></h3>
		<h3><i>I must call her soon,</i> I thought many times. <i>I must call Octavia. <p>But what if she’s writing.</i>,</p></h3>
		<h3><strong>An Unnecessary Woman, Rabih Alammedine</strong></h3>
		<h3>Consider this: In order to elevate the Prophet Moses above all men, God granted him the miracle that would dazzle the people of his era. In those days, magicians were ubiquitous in Egypt, so all of Moses’ miracles involved the most imaginative of magic: rod into serpent, river into red blood, Red Sea into parting. During the Prophet Jesus’ time, medicine was king. Jesus healed lepers and raised the dead. During our Prophet’s time, poetry was admired, and God gifted Muhammad, an illiterate man, with the miracle of a matchless tongue. “This is our heritage, our inheritance — this is our magic.”</h3>
		<h3>No nostalgia is felt as keenly as nostalgia for things that never existed.</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Myth Of Sisyphus, Albert Camus</strong></h3>
		<h3>Yes, there is beauty and there are the humiliated. Whatever may be the difficulties of the undertaking, I should like never to be unfaithful either to one or to the others.</h3>
		<h3>One of the temptations of the artist is to believe himself solitary, and in truth he hears this shouted at him with a certain base delight. But this is not true. He stands in the midst of all, in the same rank, neither higher nor lower, with all those who are working and struggling. His very vocation, in the face of oppression, is to open the prisons and to give a voice to the sorrows and joys of all.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Twelve Steps To A Compassionate Life, Karen Armstrong</strong></h3>
		<h3>It is said that a pagan approached Hillel and promised to convert to Judaism if he could recite the entire Torah while he stood on one leg. Hillel replied: “What is hateful to yourself, do not to your fellow man. That is the whole of the Torah and the remainder is but commentary. Go study it.”…It is not that other devotions and beliefs are unimportant; the point is that there is something wrong with any spirituality that does not inspire selfless concern for others.</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Border Of Paradise, Esmé Weijun Wang</strong></h3>
		<h3>Beauty, if you’re like most un-truly-beautiful people, is unlike the self, with its strangeness being part of what makes it novel, and therefore pleasurable. To love something different and inexplicable is a natural state of the human condition.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Qur’an And Woman, Amina Wadud</strong></h3>
		<h3>Just as the essential male/female is contingent, so, too, are the physical beings; there is a tranquil link between the human pair, man and woman: ‘Among His signs is this: that He created azwaj for you from your own anfus so that you may find rest in them’ (30:21). Man is intended as a comfort to woman; woman is intended as a comfort to man. This statement does not make it a reality.</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Other Americans, Laila Lalami</strong></h3>
		<h3>Perhaps memory is not merely the preservation of a moment in the mind, but the process of repeatedly returning to it, carefully breaking it up in parts and assembling them again until we can make sense of what we remember.</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Study Qur’an, S.H. Nasr</strong></h3>
		<h3>[17:13-14] And for every man We have fastened his omen upon his neck, and We shall bring it forth for him on the Day of Resurrection as a book he will meet wide open. “Read your book! On this day, your soul suffices as a reckoner against you.”</h3>
		<h3>Al-Razi, however, describes the spiritual reality of this recording metaphorically, suggesting that every deed one commits in life is like a drop of water that, no matter how small, leaves some small impression upon the “rock” that is the substance of the soul. Thus each deed — and especially repeated or habitual behaviors — eventually has a part in inscribing the destiny of each individual upon the soul…Read your book! In reading one’s own book, one effectively renders judgment upon oneself; since the book is composed solely of one’s own deeds, all individuals can be said to be able to judge as to whether they deserve to enter the Garden or the Fire by “reading” their own actions…Some describe the book in this way, “Your tongue is its pen, your saliva is its ink, and your limbs are the paper upon which it is written; it is you who dictates [it] to your own memory.”</h3>
		<h3><strong>Zami: A New Spelling Of My Name, Audre Lorde</strong></h3>
		<h3><i>You loved people and you came to depend on their being there. But people died or changed or went away and it hurt too much. The only way to avoid that pain was not to love anyone, and not to let anyone get too close or too important. The secret to not being hurt like this again, I decided, was never depending on anyone, never needing, never loving.</i>It is the last dream of children, to be forever untouched.</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Architecture Of Happiness, Alain De Botton</strong></h3>
		<h3>It is in dialogue with pain that many beautiful things acquire their value. Acquaintance with grief turns out to be one of the more unusual prerequisites of architectural appreciation. We might, quite aside from all other requirements, need to be a little sad before buildings can properly touch us.</h3>
		<h3><strong>My Mother She Killed Me, My Father He Ate Me, Kate Bernheimer</strong></h3>
		<h3>Never to be yours, he said in his mind, about his love, never to be anybody’s but ours, and he knew this was true, because he and Rapunzel were impossible, everyone said so. And to hold something impossible in your hands, not just in your heart, was a rarity God afforded almost no one.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Qur’an, Liberation, and Pluralism, Farid Esack</strong></h3>
		<h3>Inclusivity was not merely a willingness to let every idea and practice exist. Instead it was geared towards specific objectives, such as freeing humankind from injustice and servitude to other human beings to that they might be free to worship God. As has been explained, according to the Qur’an, the belief that one is not accountable to God and shirk were intrinsically connected to the socio-economic practices of the Arabs. In order to ensure justice for all, it was important for Muhammad and his community to work actively against those beliefs and not accord them a position of equality.</h3>
		<h3><strong>My Brilliant Friend, Elena Ferrante</strong></h3>
		<h3>Up or down, it seemed to us that we were always going toward something terrible that had existed before us yet had always been waiting for us, just for us. When you haven’t been in the world long, it’s hard to comprehend what disasters are at the origin of a sense of disaster: maybe you don’t even feel the need to.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Portrait Of A Marriage, Nigel Nicolson</strong></h3>
		<h3>I felt like a person translated.</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Overstory, Richard Powers</strong></h3>
		<h3>To be human is to confuse a satisfying story with a meaningful one, and to mistake life for something huge with two legs. No: life is mobilized on a vastly larger scale, and the world is failing precisely because no novel can make the contest for the world seem as compelling as the struggles between a few lost people.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Howard Zinn Speaks</strong></h3>
		<h3><p>I want to read you something that Vanzetti had in his pocket when he was on that streetcar in Brockton the day he was arrested. What he had in his pocket was a leaflet advertising a meeting where he was going to speak. The leaflet said, “You have fought all the wars. You have worked for all the capitalists. You have wandered all over the countries. Have you harvested the fruits of your labors, the price of your victories? Does the past comfort you? Does the present smile on you? Does the future promise you anything? Have you found a piece of land where you can live like a human being and die like a human being? On these questions, on this argument and on this theme, the struggle for existence, Bartolomeo Vanzetti will speak.”</p>
		<p>Of course, he never got to give that speech. But I thought that says it. You don’t want to let somebody make a speech like that. If that speech were made often enough, by enough people, to enough people, in a country where for so many people that message resonates, we might have some resounding movement for social change.</p></h3>
		<h3><strong>The Beautiful Struggle, Ta-Nehisi Coates</strong></h3>
		<h3>I paid little heed to great injustice, despite my mother showing me blueprint of slave ships and children’s books tracking the revolution of Dessalines and Toussaint. Still, I could spot even small injustices when they shadowed me personally. I knew that to be afraid while on the way to school was deeply wrong.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Little Failure, Gary Shteyngart</strong></h3>
		<h3>My father once showed up to a parent-teacher conference where one of the teachers informed him that “Gary is very smart. We hear he reads Dostoevsky in the original.” “Phh,” Papa said. “Only Chekhov.”</h3>

		<h3><strong>Rubaiyyat Of Omar Khayyam</strong></h3>
		<h3>Ah love! could thou and I with fate conspire/To grasp this sorry scheme of things entire,/Would not we shatter it to bits — and then/Remould it nearer to the heart’s desire!</h3>
		<h3><strong>Open City, Teju Cole</strong></h3>
		<h3>Each person must, on some level, take himself as the calibration point for normalcy, must assume that the room of his own mind is not, cannot be, entirely opaque to him. Perhaps this is what we mean by sanity: that, whatever our self-admitted eccentricities might be, we are not the villain of our own stories. In fact, it is quite the contrary: we play, and only play, the hero, and in the swirl of other people’s stories, insofar as those stories concern us at all, we are never less than heroic.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Qur’an Of The Oppressed, Shadaab Rahemtulla</strong></h3>
		<h3>In a global context of manifest injustice, a friendly, law-abiding Islam projected through the lens of the powerful will inevitably devolve into a theology of accommodation, toeing the simplistic lines of peace and dialogue, while an Islam channelled through the experiences of the oppressed will take on a fundamentally different character. In fact, [Farid] Esack writes, if one’s eyes are those of the world and not of the USA, then it is capitalism, not religious fundamentalism, which represents the most devastating form of terrorism.</h3>
		<h3>...the Qur’an conceives of righteousness in acutely communal terms: that is, to one’s ethical relations with the wider human family (Q. 2:177; 90:8-17; 107:1-7). In other words, it is the community — not the individual — that is the centerpiece of moral agency. As [Asma] Barlas herself notes, the text ‘defines moral personality in terms not only of ‘ibadah [worship], but also in terms of responsibilities to the ummah, and that the two are connected and inseparable.</h3>
		<h3><strong>A Little Life, Hanya Yanagihara</strong></h3>
		<h3>Now, though, as an almost forty-eight-year-old, he saw people’s relationships as reflections of their keenest yet most inarticulable desires, their hopes and insecurities taking shape physically, in the form of another person. Now he looked at couples — in restaurants, on the street, at parties — and wondered: Why are you together? What did you identify as essential to you? What’s missing in you that you want someone else to provide? He now viewed a successful relationship as one in which both people had recognized the best of what the other person had to offer and had chosen to value it as well.</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Future Is History, Masha Gessen</strong></h3>
		<h3>It took only a few sessions — too few, Arutyunyan later realized — to conclude that the rages stemmed from repressed anxiety. Shortly after, the man decided to stop therapy. Getting in touch with his feelings was too risky a proposition. “I am a tightrope walker,” he explained. “Imagine what can happen to me if I pause to think.”</h3>
		<h3><strong>Algorithms Of Oppression, Safiya Noble</strong></h3>
		<h3>Digital-divide narratives have focused on three key aspects of disempowerment that have led to technological deficits between Whites and Blacks: access to computers and software, development of skills and training in computer technologies, and Internet connectivity — most recently characterized by access to broadband…Thus, the context for discussing the digital divide in the U.S. is too narrow a framework that focuses on the skills and capabilities of people of color and women, rather than questioning the historical and cultural development of science and technology and representations prioritized through digital technologies, as well as the uneven and exploitive global distribution of resources and labor in the information and communication ecosystem.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Born A Crime, Trevor Noah</strong></h3>
		<h3>Neighbors and relatives used to pester my mom. “Why do all this? Why show him the world when he’s never going to leave the ghetto?” “Because,” she would say, “even if he never leaves the ghetto, he will know that the ghetto is not the world. If that is all I accomplish, I’ve done enough.”</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Namesake, Jhumpa Lahiri</strong></h3>
		<h3>And yet these events have formed Gogol, shaped him, determined who he is. They were things for which it was impossible to prepare but which one spent a lifetime looking back at, trying to accept, interpret, comprehend. Things that should never have happened, that seemed out of place and wrong, these were what prevailed, what endured, in the end.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Chicago Stories: Tales Of The City, John Miller</strong></h3>
		<h3><i>Never make friends in the dark</i>, is what I learned in Chicago.</h3>
		<h3>Sammie Schmaltz, the paper man, yelling his final box-score editions, a boy’s broken hoop left forgotten against the elevated girder, the people hurrying out of the elevated station and the others walking lazily about, all bespoke the life of a community, the tang and sorrow and joy of a people that lived, worked, suffered, procreated, aspired, filled out their little days, and died.</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Generous Qur’an</strong></h3>
		<h3>Do not follow blindly what you do not know to be true: ears, eyes, and heart, you will be questioned about all these. Do not strut arrogantly about the earth: you cannot break it open, nor match the mountains in height. [17:36-7]</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Master And Margarita, Mikhail Bulgakov</strong></h3>
		<h3>“You’re not Dostoevsky,” said the woman to Koroviev. “How do you know?” “Dostoevsky’s dead,” said the woman, though not very confidently. “I protest,” exclaimed Behemoth warmly. “Dostoevsky is immortal!”</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Spirit Of Tolerance In Islam, Reza Shah-Kazemi</strong></h3>
		<h3>If the diversity of religions is perceived to be an expression of the will of God, then the inevitable differences between the religions will be not only tolerated but also celebrated: tolerated on the outward, legal and formal plane, celebrated on the inward, cultural and spiritual plane.</h3>
		<h3>“Tolerance of ‘others’ is one thing, and a very good thing indeed, but the effects of taking pleasure in contradiction within one’s own identity can be richer…internal tolerance of contradictory identity is the basis of a superior and first-rate language and identity.” (Menocal)</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Bridge Of San Luis Rey, Thornton Wilder</strong></h3>
		<h3>It was not of him, at all events, that the bitterest tongue in France had remarked only fifty years before: that many people would never have fallen in love if they had not heard about it…Now he discovered that secret from which one never quite recovers, that even in the most perfect love one person loves less profoundly than the other. There may be two equally good, equally gifted, equally beautiful, but there may never be two that love one another equally well.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Homegoing, Yaa Gyasi</strong></h3>
		<h3>“Have you heard the story of Anansi and the sleeping bird?” she would ask them, mischief dancing behind her eyes, and they would all shout “No!” and giggle into their hands, thrilled by the lie they were telling, for they had all heard it many times before, learning then that a story was nothing more than a lie you got away with.</h3>
		<h3><strong>The House On Mango Street, Sandra Cisneros</strong></h3>
		<h3>My mother says when I get older my dusty hair will settle and my blouse will learn to stay clean, but I have decided not to grow up tame like the others who lay their necks on the threshold waiting for the ball and chain…I have begun my own quiet war. Simple. Sure. I am the one who leaves the table like a man, without putting back the chair or picking up the plate.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Love In The Time Of Cholera, Gabriel Garcia Marquez</strong></h3>
		<h3>He was still too young to know that the heart’s memory eliminates the bad and magnifies the good, and that thanks to this artifice we manage to endure the burden of the past.</h3>
		<h3>Before he left he suggested coming back on the following Tuesday at the same time. She asked herself whether she should be so acquiescent. “I don’t see what sense so many visits would make,” she said. “I hadn’t thought they made any sense,” he said.</h3>
		<h3><strong>What Is Found There, Adrienne Rich</strong></h3>
		<h3>To write as if your life depended on it: to write across the chalkboard, putting up there in public words you have dredged, sieved up from dreams, from behind screen memories, out of silence — words you have dreaded and needed in order to know you exist.</h3>
		<h3><strong>We Were Eight Years In Power, Ta-Nehisi Coates</strong></h3>
		<h3>I don’t ever want to lose sight of how short my time is here. And I don’t ever want to forget that resistance must be its own reward, since resistance, at least within the lifespan of the resistors, almost always fails. I don’t ever want to forget, even with whatever personal victories I achieve, even in the victories we achieve as a people or a nation, that the larger story of America and the world probably does not end well. Our story is a tragedy.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Lincoln In The Bardo, George Saunders</strong></h3>
		<h3>I could not bear it; must I, even now, be beyond all hope? (Perhaps, I thought, this is faith: to believe our God ever receptive to the smallest good intention.)</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Displaced Children Of Displaced Children, Faisal Mohyuddin</strong></h3>
		<h3>…You see,/Nothing depends on the catch. Rather, true wisdom is rooted/In casting yourself into the growing grandeur of this new love.</h3>

And if much about the Universe can be understood in terms of a few simple laws of Nature, those wishing to believe in God can certainly ascribe those beautiful laws to a Reason underpinning all of Nature. My own view is that it is far better to understand the Universe as it really is than to pretend to a Universe as we might wish it to be.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Waiting For Godot, Samuel Beckett</strong></h3>
		<h3><p>Estragon: You see, you feel worse when I’m with you. I feel better alone too.</p>
			<p>Vladimir: (vexed) Then why do you always come crawling back?</p>
			<p>Estragon: I don’t know.</p></h3>
		<h3><strong>The Unbearable Lightness Of Being, Milan Kundera</strong></h3>
		<h3>When the slaves reelected their executioner entirely of their own accord and without any pressure from anyone, I understood that it was still very early to be talking about democracy and human dignity.</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Teeth Of The Comb, Osama Alomar</strong></h3>
		<h3>Human time does not turn in a circle; it runs ahead in a straight line. That is why man cannot be happy: happiness is the longing for repetition.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Mirrors, Eduardo Galeano</strong></h3>
		<h3>Life only pulsates in what bears scars.</h3>
		<h3><strong>The South Side, Natalie Y. Moore</strong></h3>
		<h3>Cities know how to be creative in cutting sweetheart deals for new sports stadiums or companies moving their headquarters to central business districts. Cities need to apply that same inventiveness beyond downtown areas to see a serious reduction in violence. Crime isn’t an isolated occurrence. If the larger structural issues in neighborhoods, such as segregation and racial inequality, aren’t addressed, any other solution will be fleeting.</h3>
		<h3><strong>The Ministry Of Utmost Happiness, Arundhati Roy</strong></h3>
		<h3>How to tell a shattered story?/By slowly becoming everybody./No./By slowly becoming everything.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Spiritual Quest, Reza Shah-Kazemi</strong></h3>
		<h3>...one is human to the extent that one strives to do justice to the spiritual possibilities inspired within — quite literally, ‘breathed into’ — the human soul by God: ‘Then He fashioned him [man] and breathed into him of His Spirit’ (32:9). The spiritual quest is thus the quest to be fully human, according to the creative intention of God.</h3>
		<h3><strong>One Day We’ll All Be Dead And None Of This Will Matter, Scaachi Koul</strong></h3>
		<h3>So much of immigration is about loss. First you lose bodies: people who die, people whose deaths you missed. Then you lose history: no one speaks the language anymore, and successive generations grow more and more westernized. They you lose memory: throughout this trip, I tried to place people, where I had met them, how I knew them. I can’t remember anything anymore.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Progressive Muslims, edited by Omid Safi</strong></h3>
		<h3>Farid Esack: When peace comes to mean the absence of conflict on the one hand, and when conflict with an unjust and racist political order is a moral imperative on the other, then it is not difficult to understand that the better class of human beings are, in fact, deeply committed to disturbing the peace and creating conflict.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Love And Other Ways Of Dying, Michael Paterniti</strong></h3>
		<h3>Grief is schizophrenic. You find yourself of two minds, the one that governs your days up until the moment of grief — the one that opens easily to memories of the girl at six, twelve, eighteen — and the one that seeks to destroy everything afterward.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Justice And Remembrance, Reza Shah-Kazemi</strong></h3>
		<h3>Make your very life a shield for what you have promised, for there is no divine obligation which so strongly unites people — despite having diverse inclinations and multifarious opinions — as that of honoring the principle of fulfilling one’s pledge.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Exit West, Mohsin Hamid</strong></h3>
		<h3>Of this, in later years, both were glad, and both would also wonder if this meant that they had made a mistake, that if they had but waited and watched their relationship would have flowered again, and so their memories took on potential, which is of course how our greatest nostalgias are born.</h3>
		<h3><strong>Notes Of A Native Son, James Baldwin</strong></h3>
		<h3>...I think the past is all that makes the present coherent, and further, that the past will remain horrible for exactly as long as we refuse to assess it honestly.</h3>
		<h3>People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction, and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster.</h3>
		<h3><strong>A Book Of Luminous Things, Czeslaw Milosz</strong></h3>
		<h3>Adam Zagajewski: In the rear-view mirror suddenly/I saw the bulk of the Beauvais Cathedral;/great things dwell in small ones/for a moment.</h3>

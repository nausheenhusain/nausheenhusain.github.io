		<p>I cover civil liberties issues, migration, and inequities. I focus on Muslim communities; I think a lot about how media interacts with religion, and how differences in global religious literacy affect interpretations of Islam in particular.</p>
		<p>I use data analysis to bolster my reporting and the reporting of colleagues -- I lean heavily on Python for parsing data and JavaScript for front-end design work.</p>
		<p>I am an assistant professor at Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School Of Public Communication, teaching journalism with an emphasis on data analysis, data visualization, underreported communities and civil liberties. Before this, I worked as a data reporter at the Chicago Tribune for seven years, and as a senior reporter since 2019. Over the past several years, I've reported on

		<p>I am frequently asked to speak or teach about using data and FOIA skills to cover underrepresented communities, basic programming concepts and strategies, and the limits of using data in American journalism.</p>
		<p>I graduated from the UC Berkeley Graduate School Of Journalism in 2014 with a specialization in Data Journalism, and from NYU in 2011 with degrees in Journalism and Middle Eastern Studies.</p>

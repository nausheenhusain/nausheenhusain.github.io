		<img src="imgs/headshot.jpg" alt="headshot" />
		<p>I write about civil rights issues, incarceration and security, and inequities. I focus on Muslim communities and the past and present "War on Terror."</p>
		<p>I use data analysis and documents-focused reporting to frame my work, both journalistic and academic. I use R and Python for parsing data, Datawrapper for visualization work, and MAXQDA for research-based data work.</p>
		<p>I am currently <a href="https://newhouse.syr.edu/people/nausheen-husain" target="_blank">an assistant professor</a> at Syracuse University's S.I. Newhouse School Of Public Communication, teaching journalism with an emphasis on data analysis, underreported communities and civil liberties.

My work has been published in The Nation, The Huffington Post, Prism, The Appeal and The Chicago Tribune, among other outlets. Over the past several years, I've written about

			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>I am frequently asked to speak or teach about news coverage of the "War on Terror," using data and FOIA skills to cover underrepresented communities, basic programming concepts and strategies, and the limits of using data in journalism.</p>
		<p>I graduated from the UC Berkeley Graduate School Of Journalism in 2014 with a Master's degree in Multimedia Journalism, and from NYU in 2011 with Bachelor's degrees in Journalism and Middle Eastern Studies.</p>
